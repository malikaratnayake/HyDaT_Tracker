# HyDaT_Tracker
 Tracking insect pollinators in complex dynamic environment.
 
HyDaT tracker uses foreground background segmentation and deep learning-based detection to track insect pollinators in complex dynamic outdoor environments. HyDaT uses YOLOv2 as the deep learning-based object detection model.

The code for HyDaT Tracker is in the Jupyter Notebook file HyDaT_Tracker.ipynb.
